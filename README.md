# Webcam as Texture using Three.js 
 
This html creates a 3d cube in three.js and uses the webcam video as the texture.
*I only made it work in chrome at the moment, and you need your webcam plugged in so it can connect.*

## -- Update --
Added chroma option from the seriously.js library so chroma keying can also be applied at the webcam capture level.
*Settings shown work best for my situation. You will need to adjust for your own environment.*
